## 3D Modeled Goose and Assembly Manual

This project involves the creation of a **3D model of a goose** using **SolidWorks** and its subsequent 3D printing. The design process also included the development of an easy-to-follow **IKEA-like manual** for smooth assembly.

### Key Features:
- **3D Modeling**: Designed a detailed **3D model** of a goose in **SolidWorks**.
- **3D Printing**: Used **ZSuite** to prepare and print the model for physical assembly.
- **Assembly Guide**: Created an intuitive **manual** inspired by IKEAâ€™s style, allowing users to easily assemble the printed goose.
- **Smooth Assembly**: Ensured the model and parts fit together seamlessly with clear instructions for an easy assembly process.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **SolidWorks**: For designing the 3D model of the goose.
- **ZSuite**: For preparing the 3D model for printing and managing print settings.
- **3D Printing**: Printed the model using a compatible 3D printer.
- **Manual Design**: Developed the user-friendly assembly manual using simple instructions and illustrations.
